stats grapher.

purpose: gives the user a better visual of basketball statistics. run the script, auto graphs it for you.

early stages. basically a prototype of the application. 
the py file reads the raps.csv file, takes some commandline arguments and dumps out a bar graph in a pdf file.

Options:
age g gs mp fg fga fg% 3p	3pa	3p%	ft fta ft% orb drb trb ast stl blk tov pf	pts

example:
python raptors.py fg% (dumps out a graph of players fg%s)

future plans: 
- django app (then can use a better graphing api such as HighCharts to make charts more interactive)
- user uploaded csv files
- options for users

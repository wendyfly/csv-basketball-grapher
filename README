stats grapher.

purpose: gives the user a better visual of basketball statistics. run the script, auto graphs it for you.

early stages. basically a prototype of the application. 
the py file reads the raps.csv file, takes the players names and fg% and dumps out a bar graph.

future plans: 
- django app (then can use a better graphing api such as HighCharts to make charts more interactive)
- user uploaded csv files
